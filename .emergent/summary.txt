<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to fix a login issue on their ticket bot web panel, which is running on a VPS. The initial problem reported was a 404 Not Found error when trying to log in. The user provided the project source code in a zip file and login credentials ( / ). They also requested a better, more comprehensive installation guide for setting up the project on a fresh VPS.

**User's preferred language**: German. The next agent MUST respond in German.

**what currently exists?**
The project structure has been set up in , containing , , , and  directories. The backend dependencies have been installed, and the required services (MongoDB, Redis, Nginx, Supervisor) are configured. The backend  service is now running successfully after fixing a startup crash. The  service is configured but currently stopped. Nginx is configured to proxy requests to the backend. Crucially, the frontend React application has **not** been built, so there is no user interface being served.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The agent was debugging a backend startup failure. The logs showed a  because multiple uvicorn workers were simultaneously trying to create the default admin user, which has a unique constraint. The agent fixed this by wrapping the user creation logic in  within a  block to gracefully handle the race condition.
- **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING
- **Agent Testing Done:** Y (Agent confirmed the backend starts and responds to a local health check with , which returned a 200 OK.)
- **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent. The backend is up, but the UI is not. The next step is to build the frontend and then test the full end-to-end login flow from the browser.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Frontend is not built or deployed (Priority: P0)**
-   **Issue 2:  service is not running (Priority: P1)**
-   **Issue 3: DNS Mismatch reported by troubleshoot.sh (Priority: P2)**

**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1:** Frontend not built or deployed
    -   **Attempted fixes:** None. The agent focused entirely on getting the backend running and did not attempt to build the frontend assets. The  script has consistently flagged this as a problem: .
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Navigate to the  directory.
        2.  Install Node.js dependencies using  or yarn install v1.22.22

        3.  Create a  file in the frontend directory and set .
        4.  Run the build command:  or yarn run v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command..
        5.  Copy the contents of the generated  directory to the Nginx static directory ().
        6.  Reload Nginx: .
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** The user cannot see the login page or interact with the application because the UI does not exist on the server. Fixing this will deploy the user interface, allowing the user to attempt to log in and verify the entire system works.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend

-   **Issue 2:**  service is not running
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent stopped the bot service (ccx-bot: ERROR (no such process)) during backend debugging and did not restart it.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Once the web panel is confirmed to be fully working, start the bot service using ccx-bot: ERROR (no such process).
        2.  Check the bot's status with backend                          RUNNING   pid 48, uptime 0:00:11

nginx-code-proxy                 RUNNING   pid 47, uptime 0:00:11.
        3.  Check the bot's logs for any errors: .
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** The bot is a core component of the ticket system. It needs to be running for the application to be fully functional.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Backend (confirm bot functionality).

-   **Issue 3:** DNS Mismatch reported by 
    -   **Attempted fixes:** None. This was noted by the  script but was not investigated.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Run the  script again to confirm the error: .
        2.  Investigate why the script reports this. It likely compares the server's public IP with the IP the domain  resolves to.
        3.  Ensure the A/AAAA records for  point to the correct IP address of the VPS.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** A DNS mismatch can cause issues with SSL certificate validation and prevent users from accessing the site from the public internet, even if it works locally.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both.

**In progress Task List**:
None. The previous task of fixing the backend crash is complete, pending user verification of the whole system.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
  - Build and deploy the React frontend (P0).
  - Start the  service and ensure it runs without errors (P1).
  - Investigate and resolve the DNS mismatch issue (P2).
  - Package the complete, corrected, and working project into a single  archive for the user, as requested multiple times.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Project Restructuring:** Corrected the project directory structure by creating the missing  and  folders and restoring the complete  file.
- **Backend Crash Fix:** Resolved the  on application startup by adding a  block in  to handle the race condition of creating the default admin user.
- **Environment Configuration:** Created  files and updated  to load the  from an environment variable instead of hardcoding it.
- **Installation Script Fix:** Corrected the [0;36m

[1;33m⚠ 4 Problem(e) gefunden (siehe oben)[0m: Created to help diagnose issues.
- : Supervisor config for the backend.
- : Nginx site configuration.
- : Created as a template for environment variables.
- : This directory exists but its contents have not been built for production.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
The user has expressed frustration over the amount of time and credits used. Your top priority is to get the application fully working and deliver the final, correct project archive. The backend is now stable. The most critical missing piece is the **frontend build and deployment**. Do not get sidetracked. Follow the checklist for Issue 1 to build the UI, which should resolve the user's core problem of not being able to see the login page.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  : User reports Nginx is misconfigured and redirecting to the wrong site. (Resolved)
2.  : User reports the Nginx fix worked, but now the backend is throwing a 500 error. (Resolved)
3.  : User provides output showing the backend port is occupied. (Investigation led to finding the real error)
4.  : User provides output showing the running backend doesn't have the  endpoint. (Identified that the wrong/old backend was running).
5.  : User provides supervisor status. (Confirmed the correct service was stopped).
6.  : User shows dependencies installed but the service still fails to start. (Led to checking logs).
7.  : User provides the critical log showing the backend crashes because the 'admin' user already exists. (This was the root cause).
8.  : User runs the agent's final fix command, which successfully restarts the backend. The health check passes. (Backend now RUNNING).
9.  : User is very frustrated about missing files ( folder) and wasted time/money. (Underlying issue was addressed, but user sentiment is important).
10. : User reports a key folder is missing from the provided archive. (This was an earlier issue that was since corrected by the agent).

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:**
    -   Frontend UI (React app is not built and deployed, resulting in a 404 or Nginx default page for the user).
-   **Mocked:**
    -   None.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- None explicitly mentioned beyond the core tech stack.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** YES (A Deployer Agent was used for health checks, which helped identify missing  files).
-   **Test files created:** None.
-   **Known regressions:** None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **Username:** 
-   **Password:** 

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent consistently overlooked building the frontend application. The  script created by the agent flagged ✗ Frontend nicht gebaut multiple times, but the agent remained focused on backend issues and never executed the necessary  and copy steps. This is the single most important unaddressed task.</analysis>
